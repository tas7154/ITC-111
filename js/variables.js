// Variables
/*
        Variable are containers that hold data.
        The data or values that are stored in a variable can change hence the name variable.
        These values stored in these variables are grouped according to their type.
        The types in JavaScript, not including objects, define immutable or non changing values called 'primitive values'.
        There are different types : String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined and Symbol.

//          String - used to represent text:

                //Ex. 
                    var firstName= 'Tom';

//          Number - used to represent numeric value:

                //Ex. 
                    var age = 21;

//          Boolean - used to represent a logical state either true or false.

                //Ex. 
                    var canDrink = true;

//          Null - used to represent null or non-existant

                //Ex. a null value is nonexistant or has an invalid address

//          Undefined - used to represent a variable that does not have a value.

                //Ex. 
                    var emptyContainer;

                    // This variable 'emptyContainer' exists but has not value assigned to it.
                    // when it is referenced it would return 'undefined'.

 //         Symbol - we will nont be descussing symbols


/*
        JavaScript variables are 'dynamically' typed. This means that you don't have to set
        a variable to a specific type before you use it. Variable, in JavaScript can be of 
        any type and can be changed to any type.

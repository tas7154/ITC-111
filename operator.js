// Operators 

// Arithmetic Operators - used to perform arithmetic on numbers
/*
    + : for addition.
    - : for subtraction
    * : for multiplication
    / : for division
    % : for modulus
    ++ : to increment
    -- : to decrement us
*/

// Assignment Operators - used to assign value to variables
// Ex. var x = 5; var y = 10;
/*
    = : x = y; changes value of x to 5
    += : x += y; (same as x = x + y;) changes value of x to 15
    -= : x -= y; (same as x = x - y;) changes value of x to -5
    *= : x *= y; (same as x = x - y;) changes value of x to 50
    /= : x /= y; (same as x = x - y;) changes value of x to .5
    %= : x %= y; (same as x = x - y;) changes value of x to 0
    **= : x **= y; (same as x = x - y;) changes value of x to 250
*/

// String Operators - used to concatenate strings
/*
    + : adds one string to another
    += : adds new string value to an already existing string
*/

// Comparison Operators
/*
    == : used to check if one values is equal to another.
    === : used to check if value and type is equal.
    != : used to check if value is not equal.
    !== : used to check if value and type are not equal.
    >  : used to check if value is greater than.
    <  : used to check if value is less than.
    >= : used to check if value is greater than or equal to.
    <= : used to check if value is less than or equal to.
    ? : used to assing value if a condition is true.
*/

// Logical Operators
/*
    && - logical and
    || - logical or
    ! - logical not
*/
